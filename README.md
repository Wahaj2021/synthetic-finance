# Synthetic Finance Data Analysis (Python)

##  Business Problem

Financial institutions rely on data analysis to understand revenue patterns, customer financial behaviour, and risk indicators.

This project explores a synthetic financial dataset to identify trends, patterns, and potential business insights using Python.
